	<p>In 1996, Sweet Bakery opened its first location on a quiet street corner in the heart of San Francisco West Village. 
	From its inception, Sweet Bakery has been cherished for its classic American baked goods, vintage decor and warm, inviting atmosphere.
	In 2007, Sweet Bakery’s original owner passed her oven mitts to Steve and Tyra Abrams. Together, the Abrams’ have thoughtfully expanded 
	the bakery from its first West Village shop to locations worldwide. Today, Sweet Bakery can be found in New York City, San Francisco, Los Angeles and
	Chicago.In addition to our current locations, Sweet Bakery is continuing to franchise internationally.Patrons are also invited to place pickup orders for 
	select products through our online store. We are also pleased to offer nationwide shipping for a variety of products, including freshly baked cupcakes, 
	cookies, brownies and bars, as well as corporate gift packages and seasonal assortments.</p>
